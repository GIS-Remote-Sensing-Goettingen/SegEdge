# Data Directory

- `samples/imagery/` contains lightweight GeoTIFF snippets for smoke tests.  
  They are ignored by git by default; drop your own tiles here as needed.
- For reproducible experiments, store large datasets outside the repository and
  reference them via absolute paths or environment variables when launching jobs.
