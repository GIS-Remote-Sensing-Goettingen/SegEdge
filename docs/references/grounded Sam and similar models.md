Based on extensive research into open-vocabulary detection and segmentation models, I've identified and analyzed 16 models similar to Grounded SAM-2, with a particular focus on their benchmarks, VRAM requirements, and compatibility with custom backbones like DINOv3-SAT.

## Executive Summary

**Grounded SAM-2** represents the convergence of video object segmentation and open-vocabulary detection through its integration of SAM 2's temporal memory mechanism with text-grounded prompting capabilities. For researchers seeking alternatives—particularly for satellite imagery with DINOv3-SAT backbone integration—the **Grounding DINO family** and **DINO-X** emerge as the most promising candidates due to their modular transformer architectures and native compatibility with DINO-based encoders.[^1][^2][^3]

## Benchmark Performance Analysis

### Top-Tier Detection Models

**Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro** currently leads open-set object detection with **54.3% AP on COCO** and **55.7% AP on LVIS** in zero-shot settings, representing a substantial improvement over its predecessor. The original Grounding DINO achieves **52.5% AP on COCO** and sets a record **26.1 mean AP on the ODinW benchmark** without any training data from COCO. These models utilize a tight fusion architecture combining a Swin Transformer backbone with language-guided query selection and cross-modality decoders.[^1][^2][^4][^5]

**DINO-X**, the most recent addition to the DINO family, achieves comparable performance at approximately **52% AP on COCO** and **45% AP on LVIS**, while offering unified capabilities for object-centric vision understanding. Its architecture directly extends the DINO detection framework with enhanced open-world capabilities.[^3]

For universal segmentation tasks, **SAM (ViT-H)** achieves **46.5% AP** with prompted segmentation, though it requires substantially more parameters (632M) and VRAM (14-18GB) compared to detection-focused alternatives.[^6][^7]

The relationship between parameters and VRAM is generally linear, with approximately **0.02-0.04 GB per million parameters** for inference, though this increases with batch size and intermediate activation storage.[^6][^13][^7]

## Backbone Compatibility and DINOv3-SAT Integration

### Highly Compatible Models

**Grounding DINO Family** offers the most straightforward path for DINOv3-SAT integration due to its modular Swin Transformer architecture, which shares architectural similarities with DINO-based encoders. The feature enhancer, language-guided query selection, and cross-modality decoder can be adapted to work with DINOv3 features with minimal modifications. This architecture has already been successfully adapted for remote sensing applications with enhanced cross-modality blocks.[^1][^2][^14][^4]

**DINO-X** provides native compatibility as it's built on the DINO architecture foundation, making it the most natural choice for DINOv3 backbone replacement. The unified object-centric vision model architecture directly supports custom DINO variants without requiring extensive architectural changes.[^3]

**YOLO-World** supports various backbone architectures through the flexible YOLO framework, though integrating DINOv3 requires adapting the detection head and region-text contrastive loss mechanisms. Recent variants like Mamba-YOLO-World demonstrate the framework's adaptability to different encoder architectures.[^9][^15][^10]

**FastSAM** and **EfficientSAM** provide moderate compatibility through their flexible encoder designs, allowing backbone replacement with appropriate feature alignment layers.[^11][^12][^16]

### Limited Compatibility Models

**SAM and SAM 2** present significant challenges for backbone replacement due to their tightly coupled ViT architectures. The image encoder, prompt encoder, and mask decoder are designed specifically for ViT features, requiring extensive modifications or adapter-based approaches for integration with DINOv2/v3. However, adapter-based methods like LoRA and parameter-efficient fine-tuning have shown promise for domain adaptation without full backbone replacement.[^17][^18][^6][^19][^20][^21]

**Grounded SAM-2** uses a hierarchical image encoder (Hiera) instead of plain ViT, combined with a memory mechanism for video segmentation. While possible to integrate DINOv3, it requires custom feature adapters between the DINOv3 encoder and the SAM 2 decoder to maintain temporal consistency.[^22][^23][^24][^25]

## Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing Applications

Several models have demonstrated particular effectiveness for remote sensing applications:

**Grounding DINO variants** have been successfully adapted for remote sensing with enhanced cross-modality blocks that reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance on aerial and satellite imagery. The open-set detection capability is particularly valuable for identifying novel object categories in satellite scenes.[^14]

**RSAM-Seg**, an adaptation of SAM specifically designed for remote sensing, achieves **F1 scores of 0.815 in cloud detection, 0.834 in building segmentation, and 0.755 in road extraction**, significantly outperforming the original SAM by up to 56.5%. The integration of Adapter-Scale and Adapter-Feature modules demonstrates the value of domain-specific adaptations.[^26]

For **DINOv3-SAT integration** in satellite imagery contexts, the recommended approach involves:

1. Extracting multi-scale features from DINOv3-SAT encoder
2. Implementing a feature adapter/alignment layer to match detection head expectations
3. Fine-tuning on target satellite datasets with appropriate loss functions
4. Expected VRAM requirements: 16-24GB (8GB base model + 4-8GB detection head + 4-8GB batch processing)[^27][^28][^26]

Research on self-supervised Vision Transformers for SAR-optical representation learning has demonstrated that DINO-based approaches can effectively learn joint representations across multiple remote sensing modalities. The emergent properties of DINO attention maps provide intrinsic value for remote sensing applications beyond just performance improvements.[^29][^28]

## Zero-Shot and Open-Vocabulary Capabilities

Models exhibit varying degrees of zero-shot generalization capability:

**Excellent Zero-Shot Performance:**

- Grounded SAM-2: Superior video object segmentation with text grounding
- Grounding DINO family: State-of-the-art open-set detection (52.5-55.7% AP)
- SAM variants: Universal segmentation across diverse domains
- DINO-X: Unified detection and understanding
- SAM 2: Enhanced video tracking and segmentation[^30][^1][^2][^3]

**Good Zero-Shot Performance:**

- YOLO-World: Effective open-vocabulary detection at high speed
- OWL-ViT: Decent open-vocabulary detection with ViT backbone
- Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge: Balanced performance for edge deployment[^9][^31][^32]

Robustness evaluations across distribution shifts reveal that **Grounding DINO demonstrates superior robustness** compared to OWL-ViT and YOLO-World on benchmarks including COCO-O, COCO-DC, and COCO-C, which encompass corruption, adversarial attacks, and geometric deformation.[^33][^32]

## Practical Recommendations

### For Satellite Imagery with DINOv3-SAT Integration:

**Primary recommendation:** Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro for maximum accuracy (54.3% AP) with excellent backbone flexibility, requiring 24-32GB VRAM.[^1][^4]

**Alternative:** Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge for speed-critical applications (75.2 FPS) with 6-8GB VRAM requirements.[^1]

**Third option:** DINO-X for seamless DINOv3 integration with native DINO architecture support.[^3]

### For Real-Time Edge Deployment:

Use YOLO-World (52 FPS, 8-12GB VRAM) or OmDet-Turbo (100 FPS, 8-12GB VRAM) for applications requiring immediate inference.[^8][^9]

### For Resource-Constrained Environments:

Deploy MobileSAM (2GB VRAM, 5M parameters) or Lite-SAM (1.5GB VRAM, 4M parameters) when GPU memory is severely limited.[^11][^12][^7]

### For Video Segmentation Tasks:

Utilize Grounded SAM-2 for temporal consistency with memory-based tracking, or SAM 2 with appropriate text grounding mechanisms.[^22][^23][^24]

## Technical Implementation Considerations

When integrating custom backbones like DINOv3-SAT, several architectural considerations emerge:

**Feature Alignment:** The output features from DINOv3 must be aligned with the expected input dimensions of detection/segmentation heads through adapter layers or linear projections.[^17][^21]

**Multi-Scale Features:** Satellite imagery benefits from multi-scale feature extraction, requiring Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) or similar mechanisms to capture objects at varying scales.[^14][^34]

**Prompt Engineering:** For models leveraging text prompts, careful prompt design significantly impacts performance, particularly for domain-specific applications.[^35][^36][^37]

**Fine-Tuning Strategy:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, adapters, or prompt tuning can achieve strong performance while maintaining computational efficiency.[^18][^38][^21][^17]

The integration of foundation models with domain-specific backbones represents a promising direction for advancing satellite imagery analysis, combining the generalization capabilities of large-scale pre-training with the specialized feature extraction of domain-adapted encoders.[^26][^29][^28][^39]
